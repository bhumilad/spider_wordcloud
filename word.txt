Ambition 
enthusiasm with a purpose
A man’s worth is no greater than his ambitions
Clarity precedes success
A lack of clarity could put the brakes on any journey to success
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, 
but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
Commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence
Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure than
to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much 
nor suffer much because they live in the grey twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat
